- <b>Excel/CSV – as the original data source format</b>



<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda</b>
- <b>VS Code – for scripting and debugging</b>
- <b>Microsoft Excel – for quick exploratory data review</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

 <b>The project began with importing raw sales data in CSV format. Initial steps involved exploring the dataset structure, identifying missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. I standardized column names, converted data types (e.g., dates and currencies), and engineered new features like monthly sales and product categories. Using Python, I aggregated data to analyze regional performance, product-level trends, and customer segments. The final step involved creating visualizations that clearly communicate the business insights derived from the cleaned dataset.</b>
