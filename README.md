<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

 <b>The project began with importing raw sales data in CSV format. Initial steps involved exploring the dataset structure, identifying missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. I standardized column names, converted data types (e.g., dates and currencies), and engineered new features like monthly sales and product categories. Using Python, I aggregated data to analyze regional performance, product-level trends, and customer segments. The final step involved creating visualizations that clearly communicate the business insights derived from the cleaned dataset.</b>
